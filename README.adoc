=== Installation

==== Releases

The current release of *libfido2* is 1.2.0. Please consult Yubico's
https://developers.yubico.com/libfido2/Releases[release page] for source
and binary releases.

==== Ubuntu

  $ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:yubico/stable
  $ sudo apt update
  $ sudo apt install libfido2-dev

Or from source, on UNIX-like systems:

  $ (rm -rf build && mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..)
  $ make -C build
  $ sudo make -C build install

Depending on the platform, the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable may need to
be set.

*libfido2* depends on https://github.com/pjk/libcbor[libcbor] and
https://github.com/libressl-portable/portable[LibreSSL] (alternatively,
https://www.openssl.org[OpenSSL] may be used). On Linux, libudev (part of
https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd[systemd]) is also required.

For complete, OS-specific installation instructions, please refer to the
`.travis/` (Linux, MacOS) and `windows/` directories.

Under Linux you will need to add a Udev rule to be able to access the FIDO
device, or run as root. For example, the Udev rule may contain the following:

----
#Udev rule for allowing HID access to Yubico devices for FIDO support.

KERNEL=="hidraw*", SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", \
  MODE="0664", GROUP="plugdev", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1050"
